two form submissions: </br>
1, user selections source and destintion station. gets data from API to display on webpage (railtime, rail fairs, total miles) </br>
2, source is college park and user selects destintion, get preexisting data from mongodb, display same data as above </br>

form(api) - filter from source to destination station: show railtime, rail fairs, total miles </br>

form/mongodb - filter from cp to any other station, show same data but get data from mongodb so API isn't used (got from manually getting data in advance (98 total entries)) </br>
