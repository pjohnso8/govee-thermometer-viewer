two form submissions:

2, source is college park and user selects destintion, get preexisting data from mongodb, display same data as above

form(api) - filter from source to destination station: show railtime, rail fairs, total miles

form/mongodb - filter from cp to any other station, show same data but get data from mongodb so API isn't used (got from manually getting data in advance (98 total entries))
